This is a project for showcasing my current understanding of microservices. While the implementation of the 
architecture might be simple, I used this project to grow my expertise in the subject of distributed systems.
To run the project simply use docker-compose up (making sure the ports for postgres and pgadmin are not taken)
and then run the services after first running the eureka-server so that fraud and customer can register to
the server as clients.
